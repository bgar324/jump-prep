🧱 LEVEL 2 — CRUD mastery (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

💡 Goal: Make your frontend actually modify data on the backend.

👉 Project idea: “Mini Task Tracker”

Backend: Flask stores an array of tasks (tasks = [{"id": 1, "text": "Buy milk"}])

Routes:

GET /tasks → returns all tasks

POST /tasks → adds a new task

DELETE /tasks/<id> → removes a task

Frontend:

Fetches and displays tasks.

Input box → POST new task.

Trash icon → DELETE.

🧠 What you learn:

RESTful API design

State sync between client & server

JSON request bodies (fetch with body + headers)

Error handling (try/catch around multiple endpoints)

This will make you dangerous in a technical interview.
